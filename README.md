0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
Formally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:

The output is in monotonic order (each element is no smaller/larger than the previous element, according to the required order).
The output is a permutation (a reordering, yet retaining all of the original elements) of the input.

This repository discusses about sorting algorithms including

(1) bubble sort
(2) insertion sort 
(3) selection sort
